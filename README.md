# singlecell-pipeline

This repo provides computational pipelines for:

- 10X Genomics data preprocessing including standard Cell Ranger pipelines and integrative pipelines using Snakemake in a Python enrivonment. The pipelines contain analytical code for single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell CITE-seq, single-cell Hashing, single-cell ATAC-seq, etc.

- Pipelines based on Kallisto Bustools for CEL-seq2, SMART-seq, Drop-seq, and so on.
